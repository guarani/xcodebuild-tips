--- Xcode Concepts ---
- An Project contains all the resources required to build one or more products.
- A Target contains the instructions needed to build a product from a set of files in the project.
- A Scheme specifies which targets, build configurations (e.g. Debug or Release) and executable configurations is active at a given time.
  A Scheme also defines which tests to perform.
